/*
You are given a tree with n nodes rooted at 1  where each node is numbered 1 to n.

The tree is given as an array of edges where edges[i] = [ui, vi] is a bidirectional edge between node ui and node vi , and also you are given an array of queries where query[i] = ui , you have to count the number of nodes present in the subtree of  node ui for each query.

Return an array containing the answer of each query respectively.

Constraints:

    2≤ n ≤10^5

    1<= edges.length <= n-1

    1≤ queries.length ≤10^5

    1<= ui, vi <=n

Example:

Input

    n = 5

    edges = [
        [1, 2],
        [1, 3],
        [3, 4],
        [3, 5]
    ]

    queries = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output

    [5, 1, 3, 1, 1]
